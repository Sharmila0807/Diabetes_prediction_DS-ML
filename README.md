# Diabetes_prediction_DS-ML

Problem statement:

Diabetes is a prevalent health condition, and early detection is crucial for effective management. However, predicting diabetes poses challenges due to data issues, such as outliers and imbalances. This project aims to develop a robust model to overcome these challenges

Abstract: 
In this project, we aimed to predict diabetes using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset with health-related features, we employed various models to achieve accurate predictions, with a particular focus on addressing data-related challenges.

Tech stack : 

Our project utilized Python along with popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM, were implemented for predictive analysis.
